Hi, I am an undergraduate student of the 2019 batch at BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus. I am currently pursuing Computer Science. Currently, I like making apps in Swift for the iOS platform. Occasionally, I like to indulge myself in competitive programming and machine learning.


## Projects

* __CMS iOS App:__ This is the iOS version of the CMS BPHC App. It uses the Moodle API Endpoints to get data. It uses the Realm database for offline caching of course modules and announcements. I worked on several features like Offline Caching, Dark Mode, Notifications and Google Login among others. You can find the project [here](https://github.com/crux-bphc/CMS-iOS).
